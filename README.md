### To Hiring Manager
I am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp. at General Assembly and am working as a Senior Support Specailist - Front End Developer with Shopify Plus. This was my first time using Shopify Polaris and React Rotuer, so if these are not practice practices, then I would love to hear that in feedback so I can imporve in the future. I have only studied React a little bit during the Bootcamp so far, but will be studying it for the entire month of November, so will be better prepared for the Intership. I am extremely passionate about coding and love using react js. Please ping my on **slack @MedxMan**, I would love to hear any feedback from you as my goal is become a Front End Develeper on the Web Team, and your feedback will help my get there! With all that being said.....


**This project is for my application as a Intern - Front End Web Developer at Shopify.**

This application can search for images from the NASA Api from a search box.

A user can search for an image from the text box at the top. On a sucessfull search, the user will see an image, title, description and the date is was created. The user has the ability to like and unlike an image from the selection. Styled using Component from Polaris. 

I used Shopidy Polaris for the components and a fun animation when liking the images.
