# Project Description 

This project is for my application as a Front End Web Developer at Shopify. I am currently working as a Senior Support Specailist - Front End Developer with Shopify Plus. 

This page page pulls data from NASA Image Api. 

A user can search for an image from the text box at the top. On a sucessfull search, the user will see an image, title, description and the date is was created. The user has the ability to like and unlike an image from the selection.
